## Introduction

-   Multiple migration phases, **transnational lifestyle** with multiple residences in different countries at the same time (Horn & Schweppe 2017; Amelina & Faist, 2012), **serial or circular migration** (Zufferey, 2019), **and transnational family configurations** (Bryceson and Vuorela 2002)

-   “Families that **live some or most of the time separated from each other**, yet hold together and create something that can be seen as a feeling of collective welfare and unity, namely **‘familyhood’, even across national borders**” (Bryceson & Vuorela, 2002, p. 3)

-   Among migrants living in Switzerland, 7 out of 10 have **close family members living abroad** (SFSO 2019)

## Mobility and return migration

-   Decision based on the individualistic maximization of utilities (NET) and/or on **importance of social networks** (NEM - in host country and abroad) (Borjas & Bratsberg, 1996)

-   Mobility/emigration **intentions** are good predictors of mobility/emigration **behaviors** (Wanner, 2020; Bradley et al. 2008)

-   Family events (union formation, union dissolution, childbirth, etc) **trigger** and job loss **restrains** moves (de Groot et al. 2011)

    [Focus on the link between mobility and transnational families using a life course trajectory approach]{style="color: red;"}

## Research questions

-   Is having family members abroad associated with stronger mobility intentions ?

-   Is this observed at every point during the life course ?

-   How life trajectories affect return intentions ?

-   [(new)]{style="color: blue;"}How does the COVID-19 epidemic influence mobility intentions?

## Summary

-   Having **family abroad** have an effect on mobility intention

    -   **Reduce** mobility intention for **partners** living abroad

    -   **Increase** mobility intention for **children** living abroad

<!-- -->

-   **The period of life determines mobility intentions** (related to working and non-working ages)

    -   In general, migrants of the **older cohort** are associated with **higher intentions to move abroad**

## Limits (1)

-   **Methodological choice** of using two different (but complementary) surveys

-   **Selection effect:** those who have high mobility intentions may have already left

-   **Voluntary or involuntary** transnational arrangements? (Levin 2004; Roseneil 2006)

-   No information about **where** the other members of the (extended) transnational family live (country of origin, another country, …) and the **strength of family ties**

-   [**No control for COVID-19 effect**]{style="color: blue;"}

## Next step 1: Covid-19

-   The **pandemic** had an impact on the physical ability to travel, with countries **closing their borders** and **restricting mobility** to varying degrees (Bloomfield & Ratha, 2020)

    -   Announcements of border closures in certain countries prompted many people to **return to their home countries** out of concern about being **stranded** without income and lacking access to **social protections**.
    -   **Stranded migration** has led to a significant number of individuals worldwide experiencing **precarious situations**.

## Next step 1: Covid-19

### Factor affecting return migration

-   **Economy:** Job loss or Income loss

-   **Health risk:** Access to health care

-   **Travel restriction:** Prevent individual from moving

## Covid-19: In Switzerland (1)

### Economic

-   The use of **short-time work measures** helped mitigate some job losses.

    -   Companies could **temporarily reduce employees' working hours**.

    -   The **unemployment insurance fund** would **cover 80% of the lost income** from the reduced hours.

    -   This allowed employees to retain **90% of their original salary** in many cases.

## Covid-19: In Switzerland (2)

### **Travel restriction**

-   Border **closed** from March 17th to June 15th

-   **Testing** and **Quarantine** for high-risk countries

### Health

No information yet.

## Next step 1: Covid-19

-   **Covid-19**: impacted the wave 2020 [**MMS**]{style="color: red;"} and [**TAS**]{style="color: blue;"} since the data was collected in this period

-   **Weak impact on the migration plan** of the individuals ([**MMS**]{style="color: red;"})

    -   Only [**6% of MMS**]{style="color: red;"} respondents reported that the Covid-19 outbreak **affected their plan** regarding their stay in Switzerland.

    -   **It is unlikely to have an effect**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [2022](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nccr.on.the.move/viz/Migration-MobilitySurvey-Exploration/Survey)

![](covid19_impact_2022.PNG){fig-align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### But...

-   Bigger impact on recently arrived migrants (0-4 years)

    -   **2020: 9%** of recently arrived migrant **vs 5%** for the rest

    -   **2022: 10%** of recently arrived migrant **vs 5%** for the rest

**H: We expect a bigger effect of COVID-19 at the beginning of migrants life course.**

-   To compare the effect of COVID-19 over the life course, we need **data from the pandemic period in every life trajectory step**.

## Next step 2: Anchoring

**Limit: Strength of family ties unknown**

-   **Anchoring:** Way migrants create reference point to improve their socio-psychological stability

**Comparing the relative level of attachment to the host vs country of origin**

-   [Anchoring = Attach. to the country of origin - Attach. to Switzerland]{style="color: red;"}
-   Only on migrants returning to the country of origin
-   Only on migrants with family in the country of origin

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Limits (2)

-   Attachment to the country of origin missing in [**TAS**]{style="color: blue;"}

-   Share willing to go to the country of origin: [**52% MMS**]{style="color: red;"} and [**73% TAS**]{style="color: blue;"}

    -   Up to half of the data

-   **Collinearity** between having a **family member** in the country of origin and the **level of attachment** in the country of origin

    -   Anchoring = relative level of attachment
