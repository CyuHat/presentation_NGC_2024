# (1) Evolution of Mobility Intentions over the Life Course among Migrants with a Transnational Family

## Introduction: complexification of migration

-   Multiple migration phases, **transnational lifestyle** with multiple residences in different countries at the same time (Horn & Schweppe 2017; Amelina & Faist, 2012), **serial or circular migration** (Zufferey, 2019), **and transnational family configurations** (Bryceson and Vuorela, 2002)

-   **Def:** “Families that **live some or most of the time separated from each other**, yet hold together and create something that can be seen as a feeling of collective welfare and unity, namely **‘familyhood’, even across national borders**” (Bryceson & Vuorela, 2002, p. 3)

-   Among migrants living in Switzerland, 7 out of 10 have **close family members living abroad** (SFSO, 2019)

## Mobility and return migration {auto-animate=true}

-   Decision based on the individualistic maximization of utilities (NET) and/or on importance of social networks (NEM - in host country and abroad) (Borjas & Bratsberg, 1996)

:::{.incremental}

-   Family events (union formation, union dissolution, childbirth, etc) **trigger** and job loss **restrains** moves (de Groot et al. 2011)

-   Mobility/emigration **intentions** are good predictors of mobility/emigration **behaviors** (Wanner, 2020; Bradley et al. 2008)

## Research questions {auto-animate=true}

::: {.incremental}

-   Is having family members abroad associated with stronger mobility intentions ?

-   Is this observed at every point during the life course ?

-   How life trajectories affect return intentions ?

## Data and Methods

### Methods

**Pseudo-panel analyses**

## Summary

-   Having **family abroad** have an effect on mobility intention

    -   [**Reduce**]{style="color: red;"} mobility intention for individuals with [**partners**]{style="color: red;"} living abroad

    -   [**Increase**]{style="color: green;"} mobility intention for individuals with [**children**]{style="color: green;"} living abroad

-   **The period of life determines mobility intentions** (related to working and non-working ages)

    -   In general, migrants of the [**older cohort**]{style="color: green;"} are associated with [**higher intentions to move abroad**]{style="color: green;"}

## Limits

-   **Methodological choice** of using two different (but complementary) surveys

-   **Selection effect:** those who have high mobility intentions may have already left

-   **Voluntary or involuntary** transnational arrangements (Levin 2004; Roseneil 2006)

-   No information about **where** the other members of the (extended) transnational family live (country of origin, another country, …) and the **strength of family ties**

# (2) Evolution of Mobility Intentions  in time of crisis

## Covid-19 impact

-   The **pandemic** had an impact on the physical ability to travel, with countries **closing their borders** and **restricting mobility** to varying degrees (Bloomfield & Ratha, 2020)

    -   Announcements of border closures in certain countries prompted many people to **return to their home countries** out of concern about being **stranded** without income and lacking access to **social protections** (McDermid et al., 2022).
    -   **Stranded migration** has led to a significant number of individuals worldwide experiencing **precarious situations**.

## Covid-19

### Factor affecting return migration 

-   **Economy:** Job loss or Income loss  (Rajan & Pattath, 2022)

-   **Health risk:** Covid

-   **Travel restriction:** Prevent individual from moving (González-Leonardo et al., 2024)

## Covid-19: In Switzerland (1)

### Economic

-   The use of **short-time work measures** helped mitigate some job losses.

    -   Companies could **temporarily reduce employees' working hours**.

    -   The **unemployment insurance fund** would **cover 80% of the lost income** from the reduced hours.

    -   This allowed employees to retain **90% of their original salary** in many cases.

## Covid-19: In Switzerland (2)

### **Travel restriction**

-   Border **closed** from March 17th to June 15th

-   **Testing** and **Quarantine** for high-risk countries

## Covid-19:

-   **Weak impact on the migration plan** of the individuals ([**MMS**]{style="color: red;"})

    -   Only [**6% of MMS**]{style="color: red;"} respondents reported that the Covid-19 outbreak **affected their plan** regarding their stay in Switzerland.
    
## Covid-19:

**Did COVID-19 lead to an urban exodus in Switzerland among recently arrived migrants? (Hategekimana & Wanner, ongoing)**

  - Only for recently arrived migrant (Anchor and Stability)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Recently arrived migrants {auto-animate=true}

-   **Covid-19 has a bigger impact on recently arrived migrants (0-4 years)**

    -   **2020**: **9%** of recently arrived migrant vs **5%** for the rest

    -   **2022**: **10%** of recently arrived migrant vs **5%** for the rest

## Recently arrived migrants {auto-animate=true}

-   **Covid-19 has a bigger impact on recently arrived migrants (0-4 years)**

    -   **2020**: [**9%**]{style="color: blue;"} of recently arrived migrant vs [**5%**]{style="color: red;"} for the rest

    -   **2022**: [**10%**]{style="color: blue;"} of recently arrived migrant vs [**5%**]{style="color: red;"} for the rest


- **Questions**:

    - Consistent? 
    
    - Why?
    
    - How?

## Next step 2: Anchoring

**Limit: Strength of family ties unknown**

-   **Anchoring:** Way migrants create reference point to improve their socio-psychological stability

**Comparing the relative level of attachment to the host vs country of origin**

-   [Anchoring = Attach. to the country of origin - Attach. to Switzerland]{style="color: red;"}
-   Only on migrants returning to the country of origin
-   Only on migrants with family in the country of origin

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Limits (2)

-   Attachment to the country of origin missing in [**TAS**]{style="color: blue;"}

-   Share willing to go to the country of origin: [**52% MMS**]{style="color: red;"} and [**73% TAS**]{style="color: blue;"}

    -   Up to half of the data

-   **Collinearity** between having a **family member** in the country of origin and the **level of attachment** in the country of origin

    -   Anchoring = relative level of attachment
