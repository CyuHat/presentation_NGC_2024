## Introduction

-   Multiple migration phases, transnational lifestyle with multiple residences in different countries at the same time (Horn & Schweppe 2017; Amelina & Faist, 2012), serial or circular migration (Zufferey, 2019), and transnational family configurations (Bryceson and Vuorela 2002)

-   “Families that live some or most of the time separated from each other, yet hold together and create something that can be seen as a feeling of collective welfare and unity, namely ‘familyhood’, even across national borders” (Bryceson & Vuorela, 2002, p. 3)

-   Among migrants living in Switzerland, 7 out of 10 have close family members living abroad (SFSO 2019)

## Mobility and return migration

-   Decision based on the individualistic maximization of utility (NET) and/or on importance of social network (NEM - in host country and abroad) (Borjas & Bratsberg, 1996)

-   Mobility/emigration intentions are good predictors of mobility/emigration behaviors (Wanner, 2020; Bradley et al. 2008)

-   Family events (union formation, union dissolution, childbirth, etc) trigger and job loss restrains moves (de Groot et al. 2011)

-   Focus on the link between return migration and transnational families using a life trajectory approach

## Research questions

-   Is having family members abroad associated with stronger return intentions ?

-   Is this observed at every point during the life course ?

-   How life trajectories affect return intentions ?

## Summary

-   Period of the life determines mobility intentions (related to working and non working ages)

    -   In general, migrants of the older cohort are associated with higher intentions to return/move abroad

-   Having family abroad is a pull factor for (pre --)retirees’ return/re emigration intentions

    -   This effect becomes stronger for over the life cycle

    -   less important for people of working ages who recently arrived in

## Limits

-   Methodological choice of using two different (but complementary ) surveys

-   Selection effect those who have high mobility intentions may have already left

-   Voluntary or involuntary transnational arrangements? (Levin 2004; Roseneil 2006)

-   No information about where the other members of the (extended) transnational family live (country of origin, another country,…) and the strength of family ties

## Next step: Covid-19 case (1)

-   Covid-19: impacted the 2020 MMS and TAS wave

-   Weak impact on the migration plan but slight difference

## Next step: Covid-19 case (2)

## Next step: Anchoring
